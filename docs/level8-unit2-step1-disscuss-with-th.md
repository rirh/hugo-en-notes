##### 与训练教师交谈

```
Get into shape 恢复身材
Start an exercise routine 开始日常锻炼
Do a workout 从事健身
Doing yoga 做瑜伽
Get more flexible 变得更灵活
Cardiovascular activity 心血管活动
Weightlifting 举重
Go jogging 慢跑
```

```
含有 'do' 或 'get'、表示保持身体健康的搭配
 
使用 do + 名词，谈论保持身体健康的不同方法。
 

do exercise	做运动

do an exercise routine	做常规运动

do cardiovascular activity	做心血管运动

do aerobics	作有氧运动

do yoga	练瑜伽

do weightlifting	举重

do everything possible	做一切可能的事情
```

```
使用 get + 形容词，谈论保持身体健康的不同方法。
 

get fit	变健康

get more flexible	变得更加柔韧

下面还有两个 get 引导的短语。注意 get exercise 与 do exercise 的意思相同。
 


I need to get into shape.	我需要保持体型。

You should get more exercise.	你应该多做运动。

形容词 in good shape 表示身体健康，它的反义词是 out of shape。注意，由于两个形容词描述的是一种状态，不是过程，所以与动词 be 连用。
 

He's in really good shape.	他身体非常棒。

I'm a little out of shape.	我身体有点不好。
```

```
I've got to do something to get into shape . I'm overweight , and I feel tired all the time. And my muscles hurt when I wake up in the morning. I need to get more flexible . So I'm going to do an exercise routine . I'm going to do some yoga and some cardiovascular activity. I'm going to do everything possible to get fit.
```

##### 表示可能性的情态动词

```
用 may、might 和 could 等情态动词表达可能性。 注意，在其后使用动词的一般式。 May 和 might 的含义基本相同，但 may 较为正式。

You may lose some weight from doing yoga.	做瑜珈也许能让你减一点肥。

You might sleep better if you get more exercise.	如果多加锻炼，你也许能睡得更香。

He could strengthen his heart with cardiovascular activity.	他可能通过心血管活动使心脏更加强壮。

在情态动词后用 not 构成否定。 May 和 might 通常不缩写。

She may not have the strength to lift that much weight.	她可能没有力气举起这样大的重量。

Jogging might not be the best exercise for you.	慢跑可能不是最适合你的运动。

could 的否定形式通常缩写。 注意，couldn't 的含义与 may not 和 might not 不同，因为它表示可能性完全不存在。

He couldn't do the new yoga exercise. He isn't flexible enough.	他不能做新的瑜珈练习。 他的身体灵活度不够。
 
```

```
He couldn't get into shape.
他没能保持体型。
I might be able to do yoga.
我或许会做瑜伽。
You may lose some weight.
你可以减减肥。
He couldn't get into shape.
他没能保持体型。
```

The French Paradox

Many French people love eating cheese. French cooking often involves meat, rich sauces and buttery desserts. Usually when people eat a lot of fatty foods, there is a danger of heart and other health problems. This is true in a country like the United States. The paradox – or thing that doesn't make sense – is that the French suffer far less from these kinds of problems, compared with some other countries. This is the French paradox. No one is sure, but some believe it's due to red wine. Many doctors think a glass or two of red wine each day is good for the heart.
