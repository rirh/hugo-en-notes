Old friends 是指你认识很长时间的人。
 

John and I are old friends. I met him 20 years ago.	 	John 和我是老朋友。20 年前我们就认识了。

For New Year's Eve, all of my wife's relatives are coming over for a party.	 	新年前夕，我妻子的全部亲戚都来参加聚会。
```



##### 职业关系

```
有许多描述职业关系的方法。Co-workers 和 colleagues 是指和你共事的人。两个词是同义词，意思相同。
 

Sarah and I are colleagues.	Sarah 和我是同事。

Martin is a co-worker.	Martin 是一位同事。

boss 和 manager 也表示同一事情，但 boss 正式程度更低。
 

Martina is my boss.	Martina 是我的老板。

使用 acquaintance 表示你了解一点的人。这可能是个人关系，也可能是职业关系。

```

##### 搭配过去进行时的when从句

```
含有过去进行时的'When' 从句

想想过去某一时刻你正在做某事，这时被另一件事中断了。也许你正在写邮件，这时电话铃响了，也许你正在看电视，这时有人敲前门。
 
用过去进行时描述动作在某一个时间正在进行，一个含有一般过去时的when 从句用来表达动作被打断。
 

I was writing an email when the phone rang.	我正在写邮件，这时电话铃响了。

I was taking a shower when someone knocked on the door.	我正在洗澡，这时有人敲门。
```

##### 提供细节和例子

```
写下主题句后，提供支持主题句的细节和例子。细节和例子可以帮助你清楚地表达主题的意思，同时读者也可能会觉得它们很有意思。

阅读某人第一次遇见他的好友的情景。注意以下细节和例子：

swimming
8 years old
incredibly tall
taller than others
asked a question
an orange swim cap
a purple mouth
laughed

My Best Friend Natasha

I first met my best friend when we were swimming at summer camp. We were 8 years old. Natasha was incredibly tall. She was taller than all the other children. She asked me a question: 'Why are you wearing that orange swim cap?' So I asked her: 'Why are you so tall?' Natasha laughed. Her mouth was purple from eating strange candy. I laughed, too.


I first met my colleague, John, when we were studying at Duke University. He walked into my room, said hello, and then we started talking about history together. John looks like one of those little people in 'Lord of the Rings,' with funny ears. He always has a smile in his eyes. He also tells crazy stories. He has one story about playing the flute in New Orleans. He was playing on the street when a river of water came down the street. He ran! In the end, both John and I got hired by BTC. Now he's an old friend.
