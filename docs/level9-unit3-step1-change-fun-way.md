MAN: So, how are things? Are you enjoying the new job?
WOMAN: Yeah, fine, thanks. It's been OK. A lot of changes.
MAN: I know. Moving into a management position ...
WOMAN: Yeah, I certainly never used to be as busy or do so much overtime !
MAN: It'll be like that for the first couple of years.
WOMAN: And, obviously, I didn't have as much responsibility before.
MAN: You find that stressful ?
WOMAN: A little. I feel like I spend more time dealing with other people's problems these days.
MAN: Yeah, I remember these things from when I got my promotion. I used to have more time to work on my own projects, and it was frustrating when I had to spend all my time in meetings.
WOMAN: Oh, yes, the meetings!
MAN: Still, I didn't use to get so much say in what happens in our department either – it's not all bad.
WOMAN: No, there are definitely benefits. Being better paid , for a start.
